# KVM-GO Production Progress — HDMI/VGA Final, DP in Final Fit Optimization

Hi backers, a quick update to keep things clear and calm: KVM-GO development is in a healthy place and moving steadily toward production. HDMI and VGA are locked, and DP is now in the final mechanical optimization so all versions can share the same enclosure and production flow.

## 1. Final Circuit Board Optimization (DP)

* HDMI + VGA: **finalized**
* DP: **final mechanical optimization** (shortening board length to match HDMI/VGA)
* This is a **mechanical/packaging step** (not a change in product direction): it enables **one unified metal housing**, simpler assembly, and better cost control.

## 2. Accessories Progress

* Type-C to Type-A black cables: **ordered**
* Screws: **ordered**
* Stickers: **ordered**
* Openterface Toolkit boxes: **ordered**
* User manual: **design in progress**
* Product boxes: **design in progress**
* Overall accessories preparation is progressing smoothly.

## 3. Cable & Metal Parts Status

* HDMI + VGA metal shells: **ready**
* DP metal shells: **pending DP board length lock**
* Orange USB 3.0 Type-C cables: **ready**

## 4. Certification & Compliance

We’re preparing materials and test planning for:

  * **CE**
  * **RoHS**
  * **FCC**
  * **OSHWA submission**

Certification testing is currently in preparation, and we’ll share milestones as they land.

## 5. Thermal Solution (validation in progress)

Because we’re packing high performance into a compact body, we’re validating thermal designs carefully:

  * Metal heatsink **CNC** samples are being tested.
  * Multiple suppliers are under evaluation to compare machining quality and consistency.

## 6.Firmware / Software Readiness
Hardware progress is matched by ongoing software validation so the out-of-box experience stays smooth.

  * Host app builds are stable and we’re continuing bug fixes + **UX** polish

  * Compatibility testing across **macOS** / **Windows** / **Linux** continues in parallel
  * iPadOS support: we’re accelerating development of an iPadOS-compatible app

## 7. Electronic Components & PCBA

* Electronic components are currently being purchased and staged.
* **Mass PCBA will begin after compliance confirms the final configuration** (normal workflow to avoid rework and keep production efficient)

## 8. Plastic Parts

* Orange cover: tuning the optimal 3D printing profile; printing is in progress.
* Nylon black cover: **ordered**.

## What’s Next (Backer-Facing Milestones)
In the next update, we’ll share:

* DP final-length confirmation + enclosure fit check
*	Certification progress / lab scheduling updates
*	Final thermal decision (heatsink + interface material)

Thanks again for backing a small team building real tools. We’ll keep updates frequent, practical, and transparent.
